ðŸ“š How Sensory Modalities Affect Memory Recall
This repository contains the full analysis and experimental design for a STAT 453 course project conducted in Winter 2025 at the University of Victoria.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The goal of this project was to investigate whether memory recall differs significantly based on how information is presented: visually, auditorily, or through a combined audiovisual approach.

Understanding the effect of sensory modalities on memory has important implications for designing effective learning tools and educational content.

Supervisor: Dr. Michelle Miranda

ðŸ§ª Experimental Design
Design Type: Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD)

Treatments:

Visual (view a list)

Audio (hear a list)

Audiovisual (see and hear a list)

Blocks: Gender (Male, Female)

Response Variable: Number of grocery items correctly recalled (0â€“10)

Sample Size: 30 observations per treatment group

ðŸ§® Statistical Analysis
Conducted using R with dplyr and ggplot2

Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tested for treatment effects

Additional diagnostics:

Normality: Shapiro-Wilk test & Q-Q plot

Homoscedasticity: Residuals vs. fitted plot

Autocorrelation: Residuals vs. order plot

Post-hoc: Tukey HSD for pairwise comparisons

ðŸ“Š Results Summary
No significant difference found between the three sensory treatments (p > 0.05)

Tukey HSD confirmed that none of the pairs differed significantly

Residuals showed some deviation from normality but met other ANOVA assumptions

ðŸ“˜ Conclusion
Although no treatment was found to significantly outperform the others, this study:

Demonstrated a rigorous application of RCBD in real-world psychological testing

Suggests that short-term memory recall may not be strongly influenced by modality alone

Provides groundwork for future studies on long-term memory or with broader demographic samples

ðŸ§  Future Work
Expand sample size and demographic diversity

Explore long-term memory effects

Integrate emotional cues and contextual relevance in stimuli

Use more advanced models like mixed-effects or Bayesian approaches
